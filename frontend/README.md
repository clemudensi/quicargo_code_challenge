# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

cd `quicargo_code_challenge`

To start application run the following commands:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### Blockers
* Google maps API for development not accessible
* range slider - most range slider packages are unmaintained and some most others are not able to perfect fit
 for the desired feature; A feasible solution would be to create a custom range slider.

### Improvements
* Adding unit test for utility functions
* Implement ErrorBoundary for application
* Create well structured data types
* Create more reusable complement - (styled-components, MUI)
* Make some existing component flexible and re-usable
* Add storybook (optional)

### Architectural decision
Use of UI component vs CSS libraries such as tailwind-css pros and cons
